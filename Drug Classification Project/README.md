The dataset contains information about drug classification based on patient general information and its diagnosis. Machine learning model is needed in order to predict the outcome of the drugs type that might be suitable for the patient.

The machine learning models used in this project are:

- Linear Logistic Regression
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K Neighbours
- Naive Bayes (Categorical & Gaussian)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Data Set Description

There are 6 variables in this data set:

- 4 categorical variables,and
- 2 continuous variables.
