Employee churn, also known as employee turnover or attrition, refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and need to be replaced. 

It is a critical metric for organizations to monitor and manage, as high employee churn can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, decreased productivity, and a negative impact on organizational culture. 
Understanding the factors that contribute to employee churn is essential for implementing effective retention strategies and maintaining a stable workforce. 

The goal is to clarify the characteristics of employees that will churn (or that are at risk of churning), to help companies understand the causes so they can reduce the turnover rate
