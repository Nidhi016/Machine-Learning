As bankruptcy due to business failure can negatively affect the enterprise as well as the global economy, it is crucial to understand and predict whether a company is showing symptoms of getting bankrupt or not.
- The idea is to analyze the distresses in the corporate by taking into considerations different KPIâ€™s of the company. 
- These distresses often lead to bankruptcy of the company if not alerted at the right time. 

- The problem statement is to develop a prediction model which will predict whether a company can go bankrupt or not. 
- This will help the company to take appropriate decisions.

- The objective of this Capstone Project is to create a model for predicting potential bankruptcy of companies using suitable classification methods, and to evaluate the results of the methods used.

Dataset:
- The data is collected from Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The dataset consists of multiple financial ratio features such as:

- Return on Assets (ROAs),Gross Profits, Cash flows, Taxes, Growth rate, Debt, Turnover, Revenue, Liability, Operating & Net income and Expenses, etc.

- This dataset is highly imbalanced. It makes this problem very challenging to generalize well for final predictions.

- There are total 6819 samples in dataset and 96 features (including class label). 

- Out of 6819, 6599 are negative class and only 220 are positive class.
